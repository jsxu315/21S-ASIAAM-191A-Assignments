1. I created a new field, ASIAN_DENS, to represent the density of Asian populations in each county. ASIAN_DENS was calculated with the expression "ASIAN_POP" / "AREA_SQ_KM". 

2. I selected these fields because hate crimes against Asian-Americans have been increasing recently, and comparing the number/density of hate crimes to density of Asians in a county could be helpful in finding regions with a disproportionate number of hate crimes to focus resources on. 

3. Depending on how the data was collected, Asian (and other) populations could be undercounted. If the dataset was made by the Census bureau, some Asians (especially older/recent immigrants) might not be fluent in English or aware of the Census; they might also be wary of government officials and fear that their data could be used against them. 

When calculating each county's Asian density, what shows up on the map might be misleading for the purpose stated in #2. For example, just calculating the density in a county doesn't take into account the densities within the county. A county with a low overall density might have a few small, high-density Asian enclaves, and another county with the same density might have an Asian population distributed more evenly across it. The social dynamics and prevalence/causes of hate crimes could be different in the two, but the map wouldn't show this.
