            <p> I'm Jess Xu, and I'm a UCLA student studying math of computation (and considering transferring
                into engineering). I don't have much experience with activism or social change, so this quarter, I hope to
                learn some ways to apply tech skills for a good cause. </p>
            <p> Some of my goals are: to effectively critique maps and to write/design tech that's accessible and efficient.</p>
            <p> I'm also interested in making games. I've dabbled in some game jams, in which teams create a game from scratch in 
                a fixed timeframe, this year, and I hope to learn more this summer. I really enjoy the programming aspect, but I 
                also want to worldbuild and write stories; one of my stretch goals is to write a full story + dialogue for a game! </p>

            <h3>Other things</h3>
            <p> If I hadn't chosen a STEM major, I probably would have tried to go into journalism! I like seeing and contributing to 
                the constant flow of information in a community, and I started off by writing for my high school paper. I'm an A&E contributor 
                for the <i>Daily Bruin</i>, but I don't have as much time to write as I'd hoped (I wish there were more hours in a day).
