        <h1>Scenic places</h1>
        <p> Here are some places that I want to go hiking/exploring someday, coincidentally 
            all on a straight(ish) line going across the US. I don't 
            actually feel like going to Nebraska, but it seems cool to be able to fly to the middle of the US.</p>
